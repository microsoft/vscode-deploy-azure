# Deploy to Azure from Visual Studio Code

[Get it on the Visual Studio Code Marketplace!](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-deploy-azure.azure-deploy)

This Visual Studio Code extension helps you set up continuous build and deployment for Azure App Service or for Azure Kubernetes Service without leaving Visual Studio Code.

![Configure CI/CD Pipeline Demo](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dikhakha/d86193a3195f50d6125ec5b1b033c373/raw/c8e5c1452b068fd01387fcf5627029f9ac8db424/configure-cicd-pipeline.gif)

To set up a pipeline, choose *Deploy to Azure: Configure CI/CD Pipeline* from the command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P) or right-click in the file explorer. The guided workflow will generate a starter YAML file defining the build and deploy process.

You can customize the pipeline using all the features offered by [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.com/pipelines) and [GitHub Actions.](https://github.com/features/actions/)

Once the setup is completed, an automatic CI/CD trigger will fire for every code push. To set this up, if you have using GitHub as the repository the extension will ask for a GitHub PAT with *repo* and will configure GitHub Actions.

## Telemetry

Visual Studio Code collects usage data and sends it to Microsoft to help improve our products and services.

If you donâ€™t wish to send usage data to Microsoft, you can set the `telemetry.enableTelemetry` setting to `false`. Learn more in our [FAQ](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting).

## Troubleshooting failures

- **Failed to determine Azure Repo details from remote url**: If you're configuring a pipeline for a Git repository backed by Azure Repos, ensure that it has a remote pointing to a valid Azure Repos Git repo URL.
